# Tic Tac Toe in ReactJS
This project is a bigger project than others from the tutorials I am creating in my blog (and that they will be ready soon, I will post a link to them here).

Meanwhile I finish writing them, you can download this project and test it by yourself since all the code is full of comments explaining what I do and why I do that!

## Demo
Yeah, a demo is available! Test the demo [here](https://naucode.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-ReactJS/).

## Main Features
In this project we work with:
- Stateless components
- Stateful components
- Components and subcomponents
- Webpack
- Git
- SCSS
- Node Modules
- LocalStorage
- CSS Animations
- React Routes

So it is perfect to start learning, try it!

## How to install it?
Just run this code:
``` batch
git clone https://github.com/NauCode/Tic-Tac-Toe-ReactJS.git

After that, enter in the folder using:
``` bash
cd .\tic-tac-toe-reactjs\
```

And install the dependencies:

And done!
